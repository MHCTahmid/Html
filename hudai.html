        <h3>HTML Boilerplate</h3>
        In computer programming, boilerplate code or boilerplate refers to sections of code that have to be included in
        many
        places with little or no alteration. It is often used when referring to languages that are considered verbose,
        i.e.
        the programmer must write a lot of code to do minimal jobs.In web development if we type <q><u> ! </u></q> and
        press
        <q><u> Tab </u></q> key we will find the boilerplate of HTML.
